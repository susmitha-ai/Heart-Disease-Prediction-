💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict the presence of heart disease using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on clinical data such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and more to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

📁 Project Overview
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Dataset: Heart disease dataset with multiple health indicators

🧪 Workflow Summary
Data Preprocessing

Performed correlation analysis using heatmap

Visualized features using count plots and bar graphs

Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn

Evaluated performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Results
